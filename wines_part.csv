129966,Germany,"Notes of honeysuckle and cantaloupe sweeten this deliciously feather-light spätlese. It's intensely juicy, quenching the palate with streams of tart tangerine and grapefruit acidity, yet wraps up with a kiss of honey and peach.",Brauneberger Juffer-Sonnenuhr Spätlese,90,28.0,Mosel,,,Anna Lee C.

129967,US,"Citation is given as much as a decade of bottle age prior to release, which means it is pre-cellared and drinking at its peak.

129969,France,"A dry style of Pinot Gris, this is crisp with some acidity. It also has weight and a solid, powerful core of spice and baked apple flavors. With its structure still developing, the wine needs to age. Drink from 2015.",,90,32.0,Alsace,Alsace,,Roger Voss,@vossroger,Domaine Marcel Deiss 2012 Pinot Gris (Alsace),Pinot Gris,Domaine Marcel Deiss
129970,France,"Big, rich and off-dry, this is powered by intense spiciness and rounded texture. Lychees dominate the fruit profile, giving an opulent feel to the aftertaste.
